# Convolution-Neural-Network-Predictor
Given an image, predict what class it belongs to.
The dataset used is CIFAR-10 which contains 60000 images belonging to 10 different classes.
50000 images belong to train set and 10000 to the test set

I have built a CNN which trains on the data and and further using the test set to validate its output.
I have got an accuracy of about 80% on the test set.

Upload any image and the model will predict what class it belongs to.
The 10 different classes are :
['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']
